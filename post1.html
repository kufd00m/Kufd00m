            <h4>I remade the website from scratch since the old code was hard 
                to navigate in and really badly written. I wanted to get this block working
                with wordpress but that's a think I might get into later.</h4>&nbsp;
            <h4>The navbar isn't my code as I wouldn't be able to make one like this
                but as far as I know the code is free to use</h4>&nbsp;
            <h4>I dropped the idea of having a background image as I've had trouble with making
                it scale to the screen but I might implement it in the future.</h4>&nbsp;
